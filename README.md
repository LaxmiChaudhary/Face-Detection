# Face-Detection
# Problem Statement
The objective is to build a face detection model which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image.
# Description
Recognize, identify and classify faces within images using CNN and image recognition algorithms. In this project, we will be using transfer learning on an already trained model to build our detector. We will perform transfer learning on Mobile Net model which is already trained to perform object detection. To be able to train the Mobile Net model for face detection, we will be using WIDER FACE dataset which already has the bounding box data for various images with a single face and multiple faces. The output of the model is the bounding box data which gives the location of the face in an imageface in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.
